Everybody already knows functional features in Java (at least I hope) and what amazing opportunities for our code they bring. But beware, with great power comes great responsibility! In this talk I will present you some good practices of functional Java. Talk is heavily inspired by great presentation from @brmvermeer at [Devoxx Poland 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vCQPI6RXQ8&list=PLRsbF2sD7JVqUucetXQ13Ui46K54YzQYW&index=11&t=0s).
